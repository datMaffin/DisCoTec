This project contains the distributed combigrid module. It also contains the 
other SG++ modules from the release 2.0 version, because the build system 
expects some of them. I think this will simplify future merging.
Note, however, the only module which is to be further developed and maintained
in this project is the distributedcombigrid module. If you want to work on
the "classical" SG++ modules, you should get access to the corresponding project.

Important:
Please do only push changes to the master branch which are of general nature.
Please push anything that is specific to a certain application, e.g., GENE or
DUNE, into an own branch. Furthermore, please create new branches to develop new
features, e.g. fault-tolerance functionality.
